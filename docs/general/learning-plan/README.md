## Approach

This roadmap encourages you to learn in the best way that fits you. However, the plan could vary [based on your background](../faq#who-is-the-target-audience-for-this-roadmap). In general, the suggested approach is based on `Agile Learning`, which is iterative and flexible.

Agile learning uses the same ideas from Agile software development but utilizes the methodologies in the learning.
